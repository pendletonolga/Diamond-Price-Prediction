The project objective was to create a machine learning model for diamond prices using diamond physical characteristics. 
The dataset was obtained from BlueNile â€“ a leading online diamond retailer. Analysis revealed significant variance in diamond prices that cannot be accounted for by physical attributes, suggesting that additional characteristics influence diamond market.
